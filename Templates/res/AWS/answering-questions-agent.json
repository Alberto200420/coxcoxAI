Esta base de datos está configurada y mantenida por tu equipo interno, asegurando que solo contenga información autorizada y actualizada.\n\n2. **Procesamiento de Información:** El agente IA no genera información por sí solo. En su lugar, recopila datos directamente desde tu base de datos de productos y precios, lo que garantiza que la información es precisa y actualizada.\n\n3. **Procesos de Verificación:** Aunque el agente IA es altamente eficiente y rápido en la obtención y entrega de información, siempre es posible que haya alguna información que requiera una verificación adicional por parte de tu equipo humano. El agente está diseñado para actuar como un asistente, no como un reemplazo total del equipo humano.\n\n4. **Seguridad y Privacidad:** Los datos que el agente IA maneja son estrictamente limitados a los que están presentes en la base de datos de tu empresa. Esto asegura que no se recopila ni se comparte información que no sea relevante para las operaciones de tu negocio.\n\n5. **Pruebas y Mejoras Continuas:** Nuestro equipo realiza pruebas rigurosas y mejoras continuas para asegurar que el agente IA está siempre funcionando de la manera más precisa y segura posible.

Para obtener el servicio, debes enviar un correo electrónico a \"albertog1meza@gmail.com\" manifestando interés y proporcionando detalles sobre tu empresa y su ubicación.\n\nCon este sistema, el agente IA puede manejar muchas de las tareas rutinarias que normalmente realizaría tu equipo de telemarketing, liberando a tu personal para que se enfoque en tareas más complejas y estratégicas. Sin embargo, si tu equipo de telemarketing maneja canales de comunicación adicionales más allá de WhatsApp, el agente IA solo podrá manejar la parte de WhatsApp. En ese caso, puede ser necesario considerar soluciones adicionales para otros canales de comunicación."
